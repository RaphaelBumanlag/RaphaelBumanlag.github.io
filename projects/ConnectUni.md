## Overview
Our motivation for creating this app is to develop a space where a variety of students, which includes foreign, transfer, and incoming freshman students, can connect with others, tackling the issue of an overwhelming lifestyle transition into university. Our app seeks to make connections less intimidating by providing organization as well as a separation between personal socialization and school persona. It serves to encourage students to connect with others so they don’t have to put so much effort into searching for similar resources. As frightful as it is to step out of one’s comfort zone and introduce yourself to others, our app will prove to be a comfortable environment that will encourage socialization using an anonymity feature. Centered around group chats, a casual tone will create a sense of friendliness and keep our users comfortable.
