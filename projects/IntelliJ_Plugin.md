## Overview
The [MOREA](https://github.com/morea-framework) framework is developed by UH Manoa ICS professors that functions as a web development framework. At the time, there were many issues/hinderances that a professor would run into while developing their website. The process of creating modules was entierly manual by coping and editing existing modules and adding outcomes, readings, experiences, and assesments would require you to update the module file. You would also need to remember to remove your files from the module file upon deleting any of your pages from a given module. This plugin takes care of all of that for you. This plugin handles file event changes, file monitoring, YAML data manipulation, and even customizable user configurations. Now creating modules and pages are as easy as right clicking on the directory, and selecting create new module. This loads up an empty module template which also updates automatically when you create new pages. No need to worry about updating module files anymore.
